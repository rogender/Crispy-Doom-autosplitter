# Crispy-Doom-autosplitter
Simple autosplitter for crispy-doom. I don't so recommend this autosplitter in serious speedrun, because it's so bad autosplitter lol.

To use this, download, open livesplit, edit layout, +, other, scriptable auto splitter and choose crispy-doom.asl

Just test autosplitter and not so comfortable to use in every run.
